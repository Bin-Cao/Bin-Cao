I am a PhD student at [HKUST (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), working with [Prof. ZHANG Tong-Yi](https://english.casad.cas.cn/members/casm/dots/202404/t20240418_660476.html). My research focuses on **artificial intelligence for materials science**, with particular emphasis on algorithm development for **crystallography and spectroscopy**. During my PhD, I also served as a visiting student at **City University of Hong Kong**, working with [Prof. REN Yang](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/persons/yangren/). 

Before joining HKUST (Guangzhou), I earned an **MPhil in Mechanics** at [Shanghai University](https://www.shu.edu.cn/), working with [Prof. ZHANG Tong-Yi](https://english.casad.cas.cn/members/casm/dots/202404/t20240418_660476.html). During this period, I also interned  at [Zhejiang Laboratory](https://www.zhejianglab.org/), where I worked on **transfer learning for materials science**. I received my **BEng in Chemical Machinery** from [Beijing University of Chemical Technology](https://www.buct.edu.cn/main.htm), where my work focused on **finite element and chemistry**.

In recent years, I developed a series of machine-learning algorithms for **crystal structure determination** ([XQueryer](https://github.com/Bin-Cao/XQueryer)), **crystal property prediction** (PRDNet), and **novel crystal discovery** ([SimXRD](https://github.com/Bin-Cao/SimXRD)). My first-author papers have appeared in materials science journals (e.g., National Science Review and Science Bulletin) and AI conferences such as ICLR.

One of my long-term projects, **Bgolearn**, received support from the *Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Open Source Award Project Support Plan*, where I serve as the [principal developer](https://github.com/Bin-Cao/Bgolearn/blob/main/figures/funding.png). The project was awarded **RMB 500,000** to support the development of the open-source [Bgolearn](https://github.com/Bin-Cao/Bgolearn) platform. Outside of research, I enjoy **jogging** and **watching movies**.





I am a strong proponent of **open science**, advocating for transparency, reproducibility, and community collaboration in computational research.


> Due to the large number of messages I receive, I kindly ask that you first take a moment to clarify your questions and **review the repository README** before reaching out.
>
> As many common questions (e.g., debugging, file paths, resource allocation, or general usage) are already addressed in the documentation, I may be unable to reply to individual emails on these topics. **For quicker and more effective support, opening a GitHub Issue is highly recommended.**
>
> To help me respond appropriately, please include **your name, affiliation, and the purpose of your message**. Messages without this information may not receive a reply. For students interested in collaboration, **please obtain prior approval from your supervisor** and ensure that your supervisor is **CC’ed** on any correspondence. Thank you very much for your understanding and interest.
