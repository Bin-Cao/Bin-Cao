Bin Cao received his Bachelor’s, MPhil, and PhD degrees from [Beijing University of Chemical Technology](https://www.buct.edu.cn/main.htm), [Shanghai University](https://www.shu.edu.cn/) (supervisor : [Prof. ZHANG Tong-Yi](https://english.casad.cas.cn/members/casm/dots/202404/t20240418_660476.html)), and [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) (supervisor : [Prof. ZHANG Tong-Yi](https://english.casad.cas.cn/members/casm/dots/202404/t20240418_660476.html)) in 2020, 2023, and 2026 (expected), respectively. His research focuses on artificial intelligence for materials science, with particular emphasis on crystallography and spectroscopy. He has developed a series of machine learning algorithms for crystal structure determination ([XQueryer](https://github.com/Bin-Cao/XQueryer)), crystal property prediction(PRDNet), and novel crystal discovery([SimXRD](https://github.com/Bin-Cao/SimXRD)). He has published high-impact **first-author** research papers in *National Science Review*, *Science Bulletin*, *npj Computational Materials*, among other journals, and has also presented work at top-tier AI conferences such as *ICLR*. In 2025, he received support from the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Open Source Award Project Support Plan as [principle developer](https://github.com/Bin-Cao/Bgolearn/blob/main/figures/funding.png), with RMB 500,000 in funding for the development of the [Bgolearn](https://github.com/Bin-Cao/Bgolearn) platform.



I am a strong proponent of **open science**, advocating for transparency, reproducibility, and community collaboration in computational research.


> Due to the large number of messages I receive, I kindly ask that you first take a moment to clarify your questions and **review the repository README** before reaching out.
>
> As many common questions (e.g., debugging, file paths, resource allocation, or general usage) are already addressed in the documentation, I may be unable to reply to individual emails on these topics. **For quicker and more effective support, opening a GitHub Issue is highly recommended.**
>
> To help me respond appropriately, please include **your name, affiliation, and the purpose of your message**. Messages without this information may not receive a reply.
>
> For students interested in collaboration, **please obtain prior approval from your supervisor** and ensure that your supervisor is **CC’ed** on any correspondence. Thank you very much for your understanding and interest.
