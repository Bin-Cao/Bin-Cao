I am **Cao Bin (Barnie Cao)**, a researcher working at the interface of **computational materials science** and **artificial intelligence**. I obtained my B.E. from [Beijing University of Chemical Technology](https://www.buct.edu.cn/main.htm), and I am currently affiliated with the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), where I conduct research under the supervision of [Prof. ZHANG Tongyi](https://gbaaa.org.hk/en-us/article/67).

My current research aims to integrate **machine learning methodologies** with **materials physics**, with a particular emphasis on:

* **Crystallographic structure analysis** and simulation via diffraction-based methods
* **AI-assisted phase identification** from experimental X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
* **Bayesian optimization frameworks** for efficient material design and discovery
* **Generative models** for hypothetical crystal structures with target properties

I am a strong proponent of **open science**, advocating for transparency, reproducibility, and community collaboration in computational research.
